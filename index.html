            The sound tells the story of a little girl who loved swimming. She would spend hours playing in the bathtub dreaming of the day when she could swim in a real pool. As she grew older, her parents enrolled her in swimming lessons, and she quickly became an excellent swimmer. She would spend every free moment at the pool.

            But one day, while swimming at the beach, she got caught in a strong current and almost drowned. After that, she became terrified of the water and refused to swim again. For years, she avoided pools and beaches, even though she missed the feeling of being in the water.
            
            Eventually, with the support of her mother, she mustered up the courage to swim again. She slowly eased herself into the water, feeling her fear start to fade away. From that day on, she never let fear stop her from doing what she loved.
